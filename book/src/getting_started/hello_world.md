# Creating Your First Project
## Initialize Project Structure
You can initialize the project in 3 ways:
1. Make all the files manually.
2. Use `luna new <project name>` to create a subdirectory with the given project name, and all the necessary files will be generated for you.
3. Use `luna init` which creates all the necessary files in the current working directory.
## Run "Hello, World!"
Once in the project's root directory, run `luna run` to compile and execute the hello world program.
